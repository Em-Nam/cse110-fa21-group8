# Sprint 2 Retrospective

## What went well?
- Used team Slack channels (everyone kept more up to date on what was happening)
- Got the explore page to (somewhat) work
- Deployed backend server
- Sketched the CRUD operations
- Met with other group members multiple times this week instead of never
- Started implementing CRUD operations
- Finished user authentication
- Working on getting the UI tests started

## What didn’t?
- Didn’t finish CRUD operations
- Didn’t finish unit tests
- Didn’t finish database image storing
- Didn’t finish UI tests 
- No additional features were implemented
- Repo was unorganized 
- No actual function can be tested
- Unit tests were not ready

## What do we want to try next?
- Finish implementing CRUD operations
- User specific recipes and content on homepage
- Possibly limit scope
- Add in simple features like the clock
- Organize repo
- Complete testing workflow and CI/CD pipeline
- Let's get the simple unit tests ready
- Finish unit tests
- Finish UI tests 
- Polish UI 
- People outside our group testing website

## What puzzles us?
- Deploying to Heroku
- Testing syntax for UI 
- Too less push to repo (not frequent enough)
- Change conflicts (like… *tons* of them)
- Exchanging variables between pages
- Working simultaneously on the repo
